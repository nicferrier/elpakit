;;; Commentary:

;; A package archive builder.

;; This is for building file based package archives. This is useful
;; for deploying small sets of under-development-packages in servers;
;; for example elnode packages.

;; An example:

;; (elpakit
;;  "/tmp/shoesoffsaas"
;;  '("~/work/elnode-auth"
;;    "~/work/emacs-db"
;;    "~/work/shoes-off"
;;    "~/work/rcirc-ssh"))

;; This should make a package archive in /tmp/shoesoffsaas which has
;; the 4 packages in it.

;;; Code:
