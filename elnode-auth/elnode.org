* process logging
** log to a process
** code like this
(defun nic-make-log-process (filename)
  (let ((log-name (format "*log-%s*" filename))
        (buf-name (concat " " log-name)))
  (start-process-shell-command
   log-name (get-buffer-create buf-name)
   (format
    "while read line ; do echo $line >> %s ; done"
    filename))))
(setq nic-logger (nic-make-log-process))
(process-send-string nic-logger "hello!\n")
(process-send-string nic-logger "goodbye!\n")
(process-send-eof nic-logger)
** elnode-log-buffer-log does logging
*** it takes text, buffer-or-name
*** buffer-or-name could be a process?

* planned FAQ
** FAQ for installation
*** why does it not start?
**** have you got something running on port 8000?
**** how to change the port and restart

** programming
*** what's a hello world handler look like?
**** the simplest elnode handler is
(defun hello-world (httpcon)
  (elnode-send-html httpcon "Hello World"))

*** how do I start a handler?
**** using M-x elnode-start [RET] handler-name
***** the handler-name is any function
***** it will complete in the normal minibuffer way
*** how can I make a handler serve some static files?
**** so easy, like this:
(setq my-webserver-handler (elnode-webserver-handler-maker "~/directory"))
*** what if I want to do something a bit unusual to the file before it's served? like tempalting
**** you need to write a proper handler for that
**** let's say you want to replace {{{name}}} with a single word
(defun my-files-handler (httpcon)
  (elnode-docroot-for DIRECTORY
     with target-filename
     on httpcon
     do
     (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect target-filename)
       (elnode-http-start httpcon 200 '("Content-type" . "text/html"))
       (elnode-http-return 
          httpcon 
          (replace-regexp-in-string "{{{\\(.*\\)}}}" "bleh"
              (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max)))))))
*** the logging is crazy, can I turn if off?
**** yep. 
M-x customize-variable [RET] elnode-log-files-directory
**** and
M-x customize-variable [RET] elnode-error-log-to-messages
**** are 2 interesting ones

** Other questions
*** What if my friends laugh at me for running a web browser in my editor?
**** Get better friends? #emacs is a good source of fun people
**** Alternately start a new business that uses elnode and pisses on the competition
***** because it is faster and more reliable.
***** then buy new friends.
**** Or go back to using Ruby because Ruby is, ya know, really cool. Like your friends say.


* auth stuff
** things auth requires
*** test
**** are you currently authenticated?
**** most often this is testing a cookie
**** on success do whatever you were going to do
*** failure action
**** redirect to a login page
**** serve a login page

** login pages
*** test
**** are the credentials correct?
*** success
**** set a token to remember the request somehow
***** store something in the server?
****** so you can validatethe auth
******* login makes token
******* store token against username
******* put token:username:server-secretkey on cookie
******* 
**** redirect to some page
***** maybe identified by a parameter or the referrer
*** failure
**** redirect to a login failed page
**** return the same page with errors
*** links
**** registration page


(with-elnode-auth 
   (:test cookie
    :cookie-name my-auth
    :failure-type redirect
    :redirect "/mylogin")
   ...)

:redirect could be:

 a string - which would point to a relative or absolute url which must
   be mapped indepentently

 a (dispatcher . handler) pair - a cons of a dispatcher and a handler,
   the dispatcher is automatically wrapped with a detector for a url
   that serves the handler
 
 a (dispatcher handler string) list - as for the 
   dispatcher/handler cons but with the addition of the string to name 
   the url to login

** idea about data/handlers
*** for login, the processing of the authentication request (the username and password check) is the bit we can specify as part of the auth system
**** it goes
***** get a username/password
****** and possibly other things like "cookie approval"
***** check against database
****** plus any other rules, like "cookie approval is yes"
***** make cookie
***** redirect to wherever we were supposed to be redirecting
****** this could have been specified
******* as a parameter
******* or it could be fixed
******* or looked up in the server side environment
*** the bit we can't specify
**** the look of the login page
**** or even the url of the login page
**** or how the login page works
***** we need to be able to support AJAX login
***** so you can login from the main page and from non-contextual flows
*** it's frustrating because the only thing we care about on the login page is
**** the login form, which is very specifiable
**** particularly the url which the form POSTs to
***** which must have our auth handler on the end of it
*** so we need a high level abstraction for dealing with this
*** if we could specify interactive elements, like FORMs as
**** a description of the data
**** possibly a template
***** it should be possible to have a default template
***** client side template?
**** the handler code to handle the call
*** and then have those wrap in the same way as the (dispatcher . handler) form above
*** reasons this would be good
**** the separate description of the data means it could be used for ajax and context pages
**** the template is optional
***** maybe we could have contextual templates as well
****** a template for ajax
****** a template for page
**** the authentication processor is probably fixed
**** this could be the tip of a larger abstraction to do better website building

how about we make a function to return a wrap spec?

like this:

(with-elnode-auth 
   (:test cookie
    :cookie-name my-auth
    :failure-type redirect
    :redirect (elnode-make-auth-wrap 'my-app form-template))
   ...)

where (elnode-make-auth-wrap to-wrap template &optional path) 
  => '(my-app (lambda (httpcon) (do-something-with template)) path)

** templates for auth - capturing some thoughts
*** the current vogue is for mustache like templates
*** these are dumb text replacers
*** I prefer sed/xslt like templates
**** not dumb, but more introspectively transformative
*** can we make a simpler, less generic, transform language than xslt?
*** it needs to transform data, such as json into HTML or XML
*** things it might be
**** a sequence of rules
***** for this bit of data, do this
****** { "password": "" } -> <label for="login_password">Password:</label><input id="login_password" type="password" name="password"/>
***** questions about this
****** what's the pattern matching language???
****** how do we link the "things" together?
******* eg: BR tags?
******* wrapping individually in DIVs?
**** a bunch of associated rules
***** wrap everything we produce in some tag
****** eg: FORM tags
