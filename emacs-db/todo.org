* postgresql driver
** use the marsden library
** [[~/work/emacs-postgres/pg.el]]
** async plan
*** writes
**** have a hashtable db but then send writes async to pg
**** when they come back you can mark the original row as stored in pg
**** if it doesn't ever write it's because the db is down
***** and you can start really really alerting
*** reads are the problem
**** because of course stuff can change in the db but not the local db
** how does it work
*** we need lazy connection establishment
**** connection tied to a db
**** possibly a connection pool
*** db-get
**** find or make a connection
